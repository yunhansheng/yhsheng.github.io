I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago. I major in mathematics and minor in Germanic studies. My main interest lies in **algebraic topology**, **number theory**, **algebraic geometry**, and their areas of intersection. Things that I've enjoyed learning about include **K-theory**, **motivic cohomology**, **derived categories**, **Galois representations**, and **elliptic curves**.

Before coming to Chicago, I spent my high school years in the beautiful city of [Maastricht](https://www.holland.com/upload_mm/d/f/c/69557_fullimage_sint-servaas-brug-maas-maastricht-stad-eighty8things-1360%20copy.jpg), the Netherlands. Before that, I lived a happy life in [Hefei](https://cdn.britannica.com/58/138758-050-E5300BEB/Hefei-Anhui-China.jpg), China.

Here is my [cv](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/cv.pdf). You can reach me at: yhsheng at uchicago dot edu.

Expository writings
======
**Complex Multiplication of Elliptic Curves and Abelian Varieties**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/complexmultiplication.pdf)\
Final paper written for UChicago REU 2022. Hilbert's twelfth problem asks: given an abelian extension of a number field _K_, what are its generators? When _K_ is an imaginary quadratic field, complex multiplication provides a solution. It turns out that in this case, the generators are closely related to certain invariants attached to an elliptic curve whose endomorphism group is the ring of integers of _K_.

**Complex Multiplication**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/REU_presentation__Copy_.pdf)\
Slides of a talk given at UChicago REU 2022.

**On Realizing Rational and Polynomial Cohomology Rings**. [pdf](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Sheng.pdf)\
Final paper written for UChicago REU 2021. This paper focuses on the following _inverse cohomology_ problem: which graded _R_-algebras can be realized as the cohomology ring (with coefficients in _R_) of a topological space? We explain in detail the 1976 paper of Bousfield and Gugenheim, _On PL de Rham Theory and Rational Homotopy Type_, which solves the problem for _R_ is the ring of rational numbers. The paper uses Quillen's model categories in an essential way.

**Elements of Complex K-theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/K-theory.pdf)\
Final project for the course *Proseminar in Mathematics* with Prof. Akhil Mathew. I focused on explaning how topological K-theory is related to singular cohomology via Chern characters, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and the Adams operation.

**Kähler manifolds and Hodge theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/hodge.pdf)\
Final project for the course *Topology and Geometry 2: Differential Topology* with Prof. Eduard Looijenga. I wrote about the basics of complex and Kähler manifolds, and outlined a proof of Hodge decomposition assuming the regularity lemma from functional analysis. I also discussed some applications of Hodge theory.

**Commutative ring theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/commalg-notes.pdf)\
Class notes for the course _Algebra II (commutative algebra)*_ with Prof. Ngo Bao Chau.

**Brownian motion and stochastic calculus**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/385notes.pdf)\
Class notes for the course _Brownian motion and stochastic calculus*_ with Prof. Greg Lawler.

Music
=====
Here you can access some of my recordings on piano, organ, and [carillon](https://rockefeller.uchicago.edu/the-carillon). Since I am not a professional musician (although I aspire to be one), needless to say that they're far from perfect.

Bach: Italian Concerto BWV 971 [first movemet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkrxylmRx6M&ab_channel=AlexSheng), [third movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waee-g4nli0&ab_channel=AlexSheng)\

I also occassionaly write about music. These articles are often mixed with strong personal opinions. They are mostly in Chinese, although I plan to write some more in English in the future.

[所闻（一）](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-czhqmV_LL7WGRndT3vSEg) This is an article documenting my recent concert experiences.\
[幻想曲式：北德管风琴学派与巴赫](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_mw-4QJDOKoSm0dVjGMLqg) This is translated from the final paper I wrote for my music class, on the topic of Stylus Phantasticus as represented by the north German organ school. Here is a link to the English version: [The Stylus Phantasticus in the Free Organ Works of J. S. Bach and the North German Tradition](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/stylus_phantasticus.pdf)\
[一篇德语翻译练习](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/M27uN_ACzHyyAs8nz0CaPQ) This is Chinese translation of a paper in German on Bach's _Pièce d'Orgue_ BWV 572, a piece that I love dearly.\
[20210816](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UOr-OVXynU4PzciSk6kH-g) Some random thoughts and reviews of recordings.\
[暴风雨中的哲思——分析贝多芬d小调第十七号钢琴奏鸣曲](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_wPQFxA-l9xM0IVSPOoOIg) A close study of Beethoven piano sonata No. 17, Op. 31/2.
