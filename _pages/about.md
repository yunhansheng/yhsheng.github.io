I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago. I major in mathematics and minor in Germanic studies. My main interest lies in algebraic topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, and their intersections. Specifically, things that I enjoy thinking about include include K-theory, motivic cohomology, derived categories, Galois representations, and elliptic curves.

Before coming to Chicago, I spent my high school years in the beautiful city of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Before that, I lived a happy life in Hefei, China.
