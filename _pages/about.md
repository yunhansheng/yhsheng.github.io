I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago. I major in mathematics and minor in Germanic studies. My mathematical interest lies in **homotopy theory**, **number theory**, **algebraic geometry**, and their areas of intersection. Stuff that I've enjoyed learning about include chromatic homotopy theory, K-theory, Galois representations, and Fourier–Mukai transform.

Before coming to Chicago, I spent my high school years in the beautiful city of [Maastricht](https://www.holland.com/upload_mm/d/f/c/69557_fullimage_sint-servaas-brug-maas-maastricht-stad-eighty8things-1360%20copy.jpg), the Netherlands. Before that, I lived a happy life in [Hefei](https://cdn.britannica.com/58/138758-050-E5300BEB/Hefei-Anhui-China.jpg), China.

Here is my [cv](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/cv.pdf). You can reach me at: yhsheng at uchicago dot edu.

Expository writings
======
**Power operations and HKR character theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/power.pdf)\
These are some notes I took while reading Stapleton's survey paper _Lubin-Tate theory, character theory, and power operations_. It is about extending the power operations on Morava E-theory to the codomain of the Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character map.

**Complex multiplication of elliptic curves and abelian varieties**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/complexmultiplication.pdf)\
Final paper written for UChicago REU 2022. Hilbert's twelfth problem asks: given an abelian extension of a number field _K_, what are its generators? When _K_ is an imaginary quadratic field, complex multiplication provides a solution. It turns out that in this case, the generators are closely related to certain invariants attached to an elliptic curve whose endomorphism group is the ring of integers of _K_.

**Complex Multiplication**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/REU_presentation__Copy_.pdf)\
Slides of a talk given at UChicago REU 2022.

**On realizing rational and polynomial cohomology rings**. [pdf](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Sheng.pdf)\
Final paper written for UChicago REU 2021. This paper focuses on the following _inverse cohomology_ problem: which graded _R_-algebras can be realized as the cohomology ring (with coefficients in _R_) of a topological space? We explain in detail the 1976 paper of Bousfield and Gugenheim, _On PL de Rham Theory and Rational Homotopy Type_, which solves the problem for _R_ is the ring of rational numbers. The paper uses Quillen's model categories in an essential way.

**Elements of complex K-theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/K-theory.pdf)\
Final project for the course *Proseminar in Mathematics* with Prof. Akhil Mathew. I focused on explaning how topological K-theory is related to singular cohomology via Chern characters, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and the Adams operation.

**Kähler manifolds and Hodge theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/hodge.pdf)\
Final project for the course *Topology and Geometry 2: Differential Topology* with Prof. Eduard Looijenga. I wrote about the basics of complex and Kähler manifolds, and outlined a proof of Hodge decomposition assuming the regularity lemma from functional analysis. I also discussed some applications of Hodge theory.

**Commutative ring theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/commalg-notes.pdf)\
Class notes for the course _Algebra II (commutative algebra)*_ with Prof. Ngo Bao Chau.

**Brownian motion and stochastic calculus**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/385notes.pdf)\
Class notes for the course _Brownian motion and stochastic calculus*_ with Prof. Greg Lawler.

Music
=====
Here you can access some of my recordings on piano, organ, and [carillon](https://rockefeller.uchicago.edu/the-carillon). Since I am not a professional musician (although I aspire to be one), needless to say that they're far from perfect.

I also write about music. They are mostly in Chinese and are published on my 微信公众号, although I plan to write some more in English in the future.
