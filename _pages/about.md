I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago. I major in mathematics and minor in Germanic studies. My main interest lies in algebraic topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, and their intersections. Specifically, things that I enjoy thinking about include include K-theory, motivic cohomology, derived categories, Galois representations, and elliptic curves.

Before coming to Chicago, I spent my high school years in the beautiful city of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Before that, I lived a happy life in Hefei, China.

Here is my [cv](invalid).

Music
=====
Here you can access some of my recordings on piano, organ, and [carillon](https://rockefeller.uchicago.edu/the-carillon). Since I am not a professional musician (although I aspire to be one), needless to say that they're far from perfect.

Bach Italian Concerto BWV 971 [first movemet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkrxylmRx6M&ab_channel=AlexSheng), [third movement](invalid)

Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor Op. 31/2 [third movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0xY3oCbO94&ab_channel=AlexSheng)

I also occassionaly write about music. These articles are often mixed with strong personal opinions. They are mostly in Chinese, although I plan to write some more in English in the future. For Chinese readers you are welcome to follow my 微信公众号 skrjabin, where the articles were originally posted.

[所闻（一)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-czhqmV_LL7WGRndT3vSEg) This is an article documenting my recent concert experiences.

[幻想曲式：北德管风琴学派与巴赫](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_mw-4QJDOKoSm0dVjGMLqg) This is translated from the final paper I wrote for my music class, on the topic of Stylus Phantasticus as represented by the north German organ school. Here is a link to the English version: [The Stylus Phantasticus in the Free Organ Works of J. S. Bach and the North German Tradition](yunhansheng.github.io/files/stylus_phantasticus.pdf)
